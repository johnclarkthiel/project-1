###Tech used /stack
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

###Features

1. Object constructor with number randomizer function built-in
2. Six functional on-click buttons
3. Sidebar with score totals
4. Light and opacity manipulation

###Future Implementations
1. Would like to add a check/function that flips the fresh:boolean key:value pair to false when a card is used so that it can't be used again
2. The design needs to be more responsive
3. Need to re-code the hit and stand buttons ... all the conditions are hard-coded and repetitive 
4. Add animations of cards moving onto the screen
